## Introduction

When starting a new project, one of the most critical architectural decisions is choosing between a monolithic or microservices architecture. This choice can significantly impact your project's scalability, maintainability, and development speed.

## Understanding Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic architecture is a traditional software development approach where all components of the application are interconnected and interdependent. This means the application is built as a single unit.

### Advantages of Monolithic Architecture:
- Simpler development process
- Easier testing
- Faster development for small applications
- Less operational complexity

## Understanding Microservices

Microservices architecture is an approach where the application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs.

### Key Benefits:
1. Independent scaling
2. Technology flexibility
3. Isolated failures
4. Easy deployment
